docbrowse-server
================

newer, cleaner server for docbrowse.

WARNING: NOT READY YET

TODO
----

- have to publish docset helper packages & depend on them properly
- have to setup build for client into docker compose stack bullshit
- should probably add copy-tmpl-if-dne logic for cfg.yml
- should probably just replace lib/cfg.yml with somebody's decent yml-conf lib.
- should probably add proper server-side build too
